## Tea time topic

 ### 1- The structure of my project

 First, I generated the basic html in the index.html file. Second, I grabbed all the elements which am going to use. Third, I created a fucntion that fecth the tea time topic data. After that I created the function that will display the list of the tea time topis in the DOM.After that I generated a function that will allows a user to increment and decrement the votes button. After that, I geneated a function that allows the user to delete the list. And then, I listened to all events. Finaly, I stored data in the local storage;

### 2- Improvements
There are lots of requirements that I couldn't finish so if I had more time I reckon I would be able to make add button work, and then refactor my code by using module.

### 3- My experience
I had a great deal of difficulty in incrementing and decrementing the votes. I also tried to hide the empty list but I couldn't make it. I don't know why I can see everything in the console but I doesn't work in the DOM.

### 4- Something that I learned
I learned many things from this project because there are lots new things that I occured such making the archieve buttons work. What's more, I learned how to work with local storage and fetch at the same time.

### Comments
It was such an enjoyable project. Thank you so much for structuring it.
